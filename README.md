<h1>Pacman</h1>
<h4>(A fun personal project I did during the first year of my CS undegrad)</h4>

<hr>

This was a project I made after my introduction to software class which focused on Java. It was the spring of 2020 and I had a lot of time on my hands during quarantine.

I was inspired because my intro class had us make a bouncing ball on the screen. I figured if I could do that, I had the knowledge I needed to make a 2d pacman game.
I created most of the functionality entirely from scratch (Maps, animations, collision detection, and the artificial intelligence for the ghost chasing). I used the javafx framework for basic graphics and sound.

Looking back...the code is not pretty. In fact, it's beyond terrible. However, this project was a fun milestone for me after my first semester and I learned a lot of lessons that have been very beneficial.
