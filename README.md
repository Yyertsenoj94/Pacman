<h1>Pacman</h1>
<h4>(A fun personal project I did during the first year of my CS undegrad)</h4>

<hr>

This was a project I made after my intro to software in Java. It was the spring of 2020 and I had a lot of time on my hands during quarantine.

I was inspired because my intro class had us make a bouncing ball on the screen. I figured if I could do that, I had the knowledge I needed to make a 2d pacman game.
I created most of the functionality entirely from scratch (Maps, animations, collision detection, and the artificial intelligence for the ghost chasing). I used the javafx framework for basic graphic shapes and sound.
Being that this was my first project with over 3000 lines of code - I quickly learned several things:
1) Be organized
2) Plan well (which I definitely lacked here in my first project)
3) Be VERY descriptive of variables and function names.

Some days, I would look back at the previous day's work and have no idea what I did, so that's when I learned I needed to spend time refactoring to make efficient use of my time moving forward.

I will admit, looking back...the code is not pretty. In fact, it's pretty bad in a lot of areas. However, this project was a huge milestone for me after my first semester and the memories, lessons learned, and experience I gained from it was priceless.
